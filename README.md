# Dota_odds_analysis
Collection and analysis of the odds given to dota2 teams in an attempt to find some fruitful pattern.

Dota is a very volatile game that's difficult to predict. A constant changing of teams and patches only adds to the unpredictability.

Rather than trying to predict the outcome of a game to beat the odds, I've tried to find faults with the odds themselves.
Having watched the odds closelymyself, I've noticed a bias towards the favourite that doesn's feel justified
I've also noticed large swings in odds midgame, which is understandable but opens up the possibility of hedging bets.
I explore some of these ideas to see if the numbers back up the 'hunch'.
